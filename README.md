# # Project Overview

This repository contains a SQL project focused on analyzing sales data using various SQL concepts and queries.I have used wide range of SQL topics, from basic SQL statements like SELECT and WHERE clauses to more advanced techniques such as JOIN, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and nested queries.
This project helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of SQL through the analysis of music store's sales data. The dataset used in this project contains information about invoice, customers, albums, artists, genre of albums, etc. By applying various SQL concepts, I tried to extract valuable insights from this data with the help of a set of questions.
